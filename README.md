# Minesweeper Game â€“ COAL Assembly Project

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game using **COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language)**. It challenges the player's logic and reasoning while offering insight into low-level programming and system design.

---

## Problem Definition
The objective was to recreate the Minesweeper game using COAL assembly language. This involved:
- Designing a graphical interface within the limitations of COAL.
- Implementing essential game functionalities: dynamic grid generation, randomized mine placement, and interactive gameplay.
- Managing complex logic and constraints within a low-level environment.

## Solution Summary

### Grid Generation
A flexible algorithm was implemented to generate Minesweeper grids of various sizes based on difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

### Mine Placement
Mines are randomly distributed on the grid according to the selected difficulty level, ensuring balanced and unpredictable gameplay.

### User Interaction
A responsive user interface was developed, enabling:
- Revealing of cells
- Flagging suspected mines
- Smooth navigation across the grid
